# Extending your use of Project Jupyter
 
These were materials for a short presentation about ways to leverage Project Jupyter beyond the basic use case of interactively writing a piece of Python code.

We covered:

* UI elements with `ipywidgets`
* Non-Python kernels
* Frontend extensions
* The rich display system
